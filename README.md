# PFD Color Modification
Color Modification for the Attitude Indication with SYN VIS OFF. Comparing the G1000 Trainer colors to some [real G1000 photos](https://i.imgur.com/dMx1zCt.jpg), I was thinking that the colors may differ, so this is a simple trick on how to change the G1000 colors to whatever you want.
 
To be used with [Working-Title G1000 0.3.1 mod](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages).

## How to Install:

1. After installing [Working-Title G1000 mod](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages), navigate to Community\workingtitle-g1000.

2. After extracting them, place the files you downloaded from [here](https://github.com/guifarias31/msfs_pfd_color_modification/releases) into the workingtitle-g1000 folder.

My mod comes with **Option 1** colors, so if you want another color just change the color hex code inside AttitudeIndicator.js:

        this.horizonTopColor = "#COLORCODE";
        this.horizonBottomColor = "#COLORCODE";
