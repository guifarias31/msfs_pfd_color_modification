## How to Install:

1. After installing [Working-Title G1000 mod](https://github.com/Working-Title-MSFS-Mods/fspackages), navigate to Community\workingtitle-g1000.

2. After extracting them, place the files you downloaded from [here](https://github.com/guifarias31/msfs_pfd_color_modification/releases) into the workingtitle-g1000 folder.

My mod comes with **Option 1** colors, so if you want another color just change the color hex code inside AttitudeIndicator.js:

        this.horizonTopColor = "#COLORCODE";
        this.horizonBottomColor = "#COLORCODE";
